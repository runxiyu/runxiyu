Hi! I'm Runxi Yu 于润熙, they/them/他. My home page is <https://runxiyu.org>. I am a student at [YK Pao School](https://ykpaoschool.cn). I am taking IBDP examinations in 2026; I take: English A Literature SL, Chinese A Language and Literature SL, Philosophy HL, Computer Science HL, Physics SL, and Mathematics Analysis and Approaches HL.

I use my GitHub account mainly for contributions. I do have repositories on here but they are mostly mirrors of repositories from [my Git server](https://git.runxiyu.org/) and [my sr.ht account](https://git.sr.ht/~runxiyu). These mirrors might lag behind upstream a little, and not all of my repositories are mirrored. Pull requests may be processed slowly; you are advised to [send patches](https://git-send-email.io) to [my public inbox](https://lists.sr.ht/~runxiyu/public-inbox).
