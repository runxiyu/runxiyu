Hi! I'm Runxi Yu 于润熙, they/them/他. My home page is <https://runxiyu.org>. I am a student at [YK Pao School](https://ykpaoschool.cn). I am taking IBDP examinations in 2026: English A Literature SL, Chinese A Language and Literature SL, Philosophy HL, Computer Science HL, Physics SL, and Mathematics Analysis and Approaches HL.

I use my GitHub account mainly for mirroring. I usually put the "canonical" versions of my repos on [my personal Git server](https://git.runxiyu.org/), [Lindenii](https://git.lindenii.runxiyu.org), [Evosaur](https://git.evosaur.runxiyu.org), and [my sr.ht account](https://git.sr.ht/~runxiyu). Repos on my personal git server are usually, but not always, synced here every hour.
