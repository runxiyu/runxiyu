Hi! I'm Runxi Yu 于润熙, they/them/他. My home page is <https://runxiyu.org>. I am a student at [YK Pao School](https://ykpaoschool.cn). I am taking IBDP examinations in 2026: English A Literature SL, Chinese A Language and Literature SL, Philosophy HL, Computer Science HL, Physics SL, and Mathematics Analysis and Approaches HL.

I use my GitHub account mainly for contributions. My own repositories [my Git server](https://git.runxiyu.org/), [Lindenii](https://git.lindenii.runxiyu.org), [Evosaur](https://git.evosaur.runxiyu.org), and [my sr.ht account](https://git.sr.ht/~runxiyu). Some school-related repos are mirrored on here though.
